    description: "Planet Earth was 1-degree further away from it's current position in a never-ending axial precession. Every 25,772 years the earth's gravitation \"top\" rotates in a full circle. That means a single degree rotation takes (just about) 72 years. Congrats on making it 1 degree in Earth's axial precession! It is a constant reminder of how a small change can magnify to astronomical impact."
